            <a class="titulo">Overview of car leasing</a><br>
            <a>
                Car leasing can be likened to renting a vehicle. When you rent a car for a short period, you pay a daily rate based on the car model and other factors. Similarly, with leasing, you pay a fixed monthly fee to use a new car for a specific period with an agreed mileage, returning it once the lease term concludes. Unlike buying, there's no option to purchase the vehicle; you simply return it, concluding the lease agreement.
                Leasing is also known as personal contract hire (PCH) or business contract hire (BCH). Both terms essentially refer to whether an individual or a business is leasing a vehicle.
                At LINGs we may also offer car leasing on pre registered or used cars. These work in the same was as leasing a brand new unregistered car. The Road tax will still be included for the full duration of the lease and it will still come with the remaining manufacturers warranty but MOT’s and services may be due sooner.
            </a><br><br>
            <a class="titulo">How does car leasing work?</a><br>
            <a>
                When you lease a car (typically a new car, although we may offer some pre registered or used cars) the cost of the contract is split up into equal monthly payments. The length of the contract varies depending on what you choose but typically goes from 18 months to 4 years. In most cases you will pay an initial payment is made in the first month which is then followed by fixed monthly payments for the remainder of the contract.
                Lease deals are often presented as two numbers, such as '3+ 23.' This indicates an upfront payment equivalent to 3 months, followed by 23 consecutive monthly payments, resulting in a total contract duration of 24 months.
                An example of this would be a car advertised as £400 including VAT per month on a 3+23 profile would mean the initial payment is £1,200 followed by 23 payments of £400.
                When selecting a car to lease, you typically have numerous options, including the make, model, and specifications. The lease contract is tailored to the specific model, estimated mileage, contract duration, and payment structure, offering considerable flexibility.

            <a class="titulo">They key features of contract hire are:</a><br>
            <a>
                1. Fixed monthly payments cover the rental of the vehicle (you can also include any maintenance options if required.)<br>
                2. The monthly rentals are calculated by taking into consideration things such as: the cost of the vehicle, the contract period, the anticipated residual value of the car, the mileage allowance per year (which is agreed by yourself before you enter the agreement), any additional options such as tow bars/paint options or maintenance packages.<br>
                3. You never own the vehicle whilst you are paying the monthly rentals. It remains the property of the finance company during the contract. This means you do not have to worry about any deprecating value.
            </a><br><br>
            <a class="titulo">Some key benefits of contract hire</a><br>
            <a>
                1. Low upfront Payments: Commence your lease with a minimal upfront rental cost from as little as 1 month upfront.<br>
                2. Stable Payments: Enjoy fixed rentals throughout the entire package.<br>
                3. Flexibility: Tailor terms to align with your financial needs and driving preferences, including variable contract durations and mileage terms.<br>
                4. Inclusive Services: Monthly rentals cover road tax (VED) and breakdown cover.<br>
                5. Optional Maintenance: Include vehicle maintenance in monthly fees to evenly spread the associated costs.<br>
                6. Worry-Free Return: When returning the vehicle at the agreement's end, there's no need to concern yourself with its depreciation or disposal.

            <a class="titulo">Things to take into consideration for contract hire</a><br>
            <a>
                1. Terminating the contract earlier can be expensive.<br>
                2. If you exceed your agreed contract mileage the excess mileage charges can be expensive as they are based on a ‘pence per mile’ basis set out in each contract.<br>
                3. You must return the vehicle in a well maintained condition. Any damage over and above that stated in the Fair Wear and Tear Guide will be subject to additional charges.<br>
                4. Vehicle must be insured with full comprehensive cover.<br>
                5. You will never own the vehicle as there is no option to buy it.
